It's been a while so I wanted to give a little update on a few cosmetic changes and one functional change.

I threw some old Yakima 1A racks I purchased used so I could throw the surf board on and head to the beach. I used raw aluminum tubing for the rails because I really didn't like the rubber covered ones that Yakima has, and I want the rails to patina a bit to match the rest of the car :) Next step... learn to surf. Of course I need a few window stickers to compliment the racks.

The other thing I added was custom emblems created by [Custom Car Emblems on Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/CustomCarEmblems). I wanted something on the fender to break up the side a bit and had some custom emblems made that sorta reflected the style of the SC/Rambler emblems, but with my own flare. The JZ is for the 1JZ motor, and Hardway is a tip of the hat to my buddy who owns a shop back in Kansas City where I grew up.
