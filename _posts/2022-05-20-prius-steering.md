I drove around for almost a year with manual steering. While not... terrible... it is slightly less enjoyable especially when parking and tight spots. 

The plan was always to have electric power steering, but I couldn't figure out how to fit it all in. There's an excellent [post here](https://www.therangerstation.com/tech/toyota-electric-power-steering-eps-conversion/) that describes the details and wiring of the Prius electric steering module, check it out if you'd like to do the same.

I've seen also an old Falcon (that's similar to the Rambler) [conversion here](https://ls1tech.com/forums/suspension-brakes/1848775-35-electric-power-steering-fail-safe-no-ebay-module-no-caster-issues.html#post19425307). 

The main issue is that I 1000% wanted to keep the column steering and bench seat. I felt like it would lose something important with buckets and a floor shifter. The problem is that you can't lop off the steering column like others have if you have a column shifter. 

What I ended up doing was shortening the entire column/shifter as much as I could. This gave me just enough room to add the Prius electric steering unit in the engine bay.
