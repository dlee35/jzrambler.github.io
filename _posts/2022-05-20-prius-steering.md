I drove around for almost a year with manual steering. While not... terrible... it is slightly less enjoyable especially when parking and tight spots. 

The plan was always to have electric power steering, but I couldn't figure out how to fit it all in. There's an excellent [post here](https://www.therangerstation.com/tech/toyota-electric-power-steering-eps-conversion/) that describes the details and wiring of the Prius electric steering module, check it out if you'd like to do the same.

I've seen also an old Falcon (that's similar to the Rambler) [conversion here](https://ls1tech.com/forums/suspension-brakes/1848775-35-electric-power-steering-fail-safe-no-ebay-module-no-caster-issues.html#post19425307). 

The main issue is that I 1000% wanted to keep the column steering and bench seat. I felt like it would lose something important with buckets and a floor shifter. The problem is that you can't lop off the steering column like others have if you have a column shifter. 

What I ended up doing was shortening the entire column/shifter as much as I could. This gave me just enough room to add the Prius electric steering unit in the engine bay. 

Cutting the column:

Modifying the shafts. Each shaft is welded and contains multiple 3/16" pins for strength:

Mocked up column using exahust tube:

Dry fit in the engine bay:

Cleaning Up:

I had to modify the horn mount so I could use a OEM Rambler button:

I swapped out the steering wheel because even though I love the original, it's just too damn big. I'm a pretty small guy and I still had to squirrel around it. This one is an inch smaller and a much better feel:
